**Why use Markdown?**

Markdown is a simple markup language that is converted to valid HTML. And it has many great features:

* Incredibly simple syntax, so symple that it is hard to call it a syntax.
* Fast deployment, much faster than the annoying tags of HTML.
* It is portable. Since Markdown files are just plain text you don't need any fancy editor.
* It is clean. No messy code. Much better than writing yourself from scratch or exporting from Microsoft Word or similars.

You can do almost *anything* with Markdown:

> Blockquotes, to put emphasis of a block of text, or maybe to quote someone.

Very simple [links](http://example.com/) are actually simple.

1. Numbered lists
2. Very fancy!

<hr>

To mention pieces of code, you only need to put it around back-quotes `.

For example the `explode()` function of php has a very funny name.

Images are also really simple! Look!

![Alt text]({resource.1} "Optional title")

If Markdown can't do what you want, no problem! You can put HTML code in the middle of the Markdown text and it will work!
